## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Coding Style

To keep the source consistent, readable, diffable and easy to merge, we use a
fairly rigid coding style, as defined by the
[google-styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide) project. All patches
will be expected to conform to the style outlined
[here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

Note that for public interfaces that are intended to be P0214 conforming, use
the proposed name; otherwise use the name style suggested by the style guide.

## Code reviews

* All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.
We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for
more information on using pull requests.

* If you are a Googler, it is preferable to first create an internal CL and
have it reviewed and submitted. All these changes will be manually rebased
to upstream, until we automate this.

## Running Tests
